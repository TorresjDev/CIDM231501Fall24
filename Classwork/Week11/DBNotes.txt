   # Data Representation & Database - DB
   # Data applications need solutions to store large quantity of data and can easily manage these data

   * Database 
      # A large integrated collection of data 
      # Can be modeled as a collection of entities or relationship among entities
         # Entity: 
            - Real-world object distinguishable from other objects
            - entity is described in DB using a set of attributes
         # Relationship: 
            - Association among two or more entities
            - E.G. Instructors teach Students 

   * Database Management System(DBMS)
      # Software packages implement, store & manage Database
      # API: Application Programming Interface

   Why do we need DB % DBMS?
      # Provide quick and safe access to store and manage data
      # Security: protect, recover and backup
